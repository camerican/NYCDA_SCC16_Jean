		<p><img src="img/MusicalME_Images_tagline.jpg" height=100% width=100%></p>
		<br>MusicalMe Apps are created by uSOUNDit Partners LLC, veterans of the musical theatre industry in New York City. The apps use patented technology created by musicians to bring an in-depth musical and visual experience that no other app in the marketplace provides. The app either analyzes the colors within an image and translates them using algorithms to create melody and volume, notes, keys and pitches, or uses motion sensing technology to translate movements into music.  MusicalMe Apps provide a fun, spontaneous interactive experience for basic users, and a trailblazing composition opportunity for those more knowledgeable about music.

		<p><img src="img/IMG_1215.JPG" height=100% width=100%></p>
	<br>The Witte Museum guided audio tour was created by students of Codeup, a San Antonio based LAMP (Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP) full-stack web development accelerator that prepares students to become software developers. The site was built on a Laravel framework, utilizing JQuery for the audio player. The tour includes special commentary and perspective from Museum curators and other scholars about artifacts in the Witte collection. The Splendor on the Range exhibit has experienced a 50% increase in visitor attendance since the launch in late July 2016.
