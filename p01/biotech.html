		<div class="figures"><a class="tech" href="http://http://neoneuron.org//">NeoNeuron</a><br>Neural cells derived from various sources of stem cells or from reprogrammed adult somatic cells provide unique opportunities for developing authentic in vitro models for basic biology and drug discovery and therapeutic neural stem cell lines for brain repair. NeoNeuron applies technologies to purify homogenous populations of neural stem cell lines and coax them to specific types of cells lost to injuries or diseases. The technology was developed by Marcel Daadi, Ph.D. at Stanford University School of Medicine. Dr. Daadi is currently the Associate Scientist & Director, Stem Cells & Regenerative Medicine at the Southwest National Primate Research Center at Texas Biomedical Research Institute in San Antonio, TX.
